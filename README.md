### ResetBox

This device will turn off DC power supply if a longer press on external switch
is detected. Status will be communicated on external LED.


#### Operation

Press and hold button for 3 seconds until LED decreases in brightness. Once
button is released, device will reset. If you hold button even longer (additional
10 second after LED has dimmed) power off operation will be cancelled.


#### Set Voltage

Output devices MUST be disconnected during this time unless they can handle
full 20 V.

Unplug USB cable and hold internal button while plugging it back in until ACT
LED stops blinking (about 3 seconds). No you can release button. In config mode,
press internal button once for each voltage step. Once voltage has been
selected, long press internal button to save the value. Once blinking stops,
release the button and device will start normally.
